use create-react-app to start the project

to create the cathegories slider , I will be using a react library call react slick: https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/get-started
this help us to create really easy sliders, need to use : npm install react-slick --save
for more information check https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/get-started

I start using React-router to connect and switch elements and start using bootstrap imported to app.js, to work with CSS, remember after the pull to run npm install so it update your dependencies.
