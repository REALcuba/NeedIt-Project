Description:---
In this project.Our team is going to work on the idea of donation to the needy people.people who have the extra stuff can donate on the needit website.Its based on the ides of recycle.
Why We feel the need of this project:
1)the first and most important step is humanity.It stengthens it and motivate people to help each other.
2)People can give and take  stuff in their available time.
3)To throw wastage and extra materials,there are limited hours,this way the limited hours and specific day problem will be solved.
4)It makes the enviornment more clean and healthy.
5)It encourages people to donate more because more they donate more they get extra points when they act as taker.
---How do we apply through the app ---
1)We will create "Login" to register users(both giver and taker).They need to provide information and verify themselves to avoid scams.
2)There is another "SignIn" to acess the website.
3)They can easily do the chat to each other through the "chat window".
4)There will be "search bar" to search the specific item on the home page.
5)User can also rewared with the points and give feedback.
On listing items user can post items with description,photo and quanity.
